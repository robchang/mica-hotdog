This skill is the single entry point: enumerate subproblems, classify each as library/asset/service, walk through them in order with the matching procedure. Lookup discipline is calibrated by model class via the runtime banner's `recallProfile`: high/medium/low confidence categories recall + verify, very-low confidence categories skip recall and go directly to Search craft + Asset URL Extract Pattern (`tavily_extract` with include_images, or `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` with site-restricted queries).

Library / asset is the default for any non-trivial subproblem; bespoke implementation is the exception that requires a documented "nothing fits because Z" decision.

# Discover external dependencies — libraries, assets, services

Most non-trivial cards pull from three kinds of external resources:

- **Library** — executable JS code, loaded as a script tag.
- **Asset** — bytes loaded as a file (image, audio, video, font, 3D model, data file).
- **Service** — a live endpoint hit at runtime (data API, tile server, etc.).

A single card commonly needs more than one kind: a rendering library plus its textures, a chart library plus a data service, a gallery built from assets alone. Each subproblem is one kind; a card has multiple subproblems. Classify each separately.

Three failure modes to plan against:

1. Writing many lines of from-scratch geometry / parsing / protocol code when a one-line library call would suffice.
2. Shipping image URLs that resolve in `curl` but fail in WebGL because the host doesn't send CORS.
3. Wiring up an API endpoint whose response shape was guessed instead of verified.

**Recall, then verify. Search only when recall fails.**

## When this skill fires

Whenever you're about to design or implement a subproblem that pulls from outside the project directory. Specifically:

- **During spec drafting** (card-class builds via `card-class-handbook`): each entry in `## Subproblems and their solutions` goes through this skill.
- **During plan writing** (decomposed builds via `task-decomposer`): each subcomponent with implementation logic goes through this skill; the chosen dependencies land in `interfaces.md § Dependency versions`.
- **During bug fixes** (via `fix-bug`): if your fix would need >30 lines of new bespoke code, or pulls in a new external resource, run this skill first.
- **Recursively, per subproblem.** Picking one library to cover the main visual does NOT discharge discovery for sub-features built on top. Every named overlay, plugin-shaped behavior, or distinct visual element is its OWN subproblem — most popular UI libraries have a plugin ecosystem, and "library X with plugin Y" almost always beats "library X plus bespoke math reimplementing Y" on both correctness and lines-of-code. Tile servers, marker icons, and other ancillary resources are their own asset/service subproblems too.

## Step 0 — does Mica already provide this capability?

**Before searching the open web, check Mica's own discovery surface.** Many capabilities are already wired in via channel handlers or built-in card classes — picking those is cheaper than authoring a new CDN dependency, AND it avoids per-card churn for things Mica is responsible for (auth, model selection, error handling, lifecycle).

Three tool calls cover the inventory:

1. **`mica_list_handlers()`** — every registered channel handler (e.g. `llm-direct`, `llm-agent`, `process`) with its `whenToUse`, args, and `modelConstraints` (per-model limits and capabilities — vision support, max images per turn, output token cap, gotchas). **This is THE surface for "Mica already has a vision model / chat model / subprocess wrapper / agent loop."**
2. **`mica_list_classes()`** — every card class on disk (built-in + project-scoped). Each entry shows the `handler` it uses (or `(sidecar)` / `(static)`) and `defaultTitle`. Tells you whether a card class already wraps the capability you want.
3. **`curl /api/handlers`** — full manifest detail for any handler you picked: `sendShapes`, `recvShapes`, `examples` (copy-pasteable card.js skeletons covering common usage), `argsSchema` (every config knob). Use AFTER `mica_list_handlers` narrows the choice.

**Common capability → handler mapping (verify each via the tools above; this is recall, not the source of truth):**

| Subproblem | Likely Mica-provided path |
|---|---|
| Classify / describe / extract from an image | `llm-direct` + a vision-capable model |
| Stream LLM completions for chat / summarization / rewriting | `llm-direct` + a text model |
| Tool-using agent inside a card | `llm-agent` (lighter than the project-wide chat card) |
| Wrap a CLI tool | `process` handler — Tier 3, zero server code |
| Voice STT / TTS | already-running sidecars — see the `voice` built-in card class |

If a Mica path fits → spec records *"uses handler X / card class Y; verified via mica_list_handlers"* and you skip web search for that subproblem. If nothing fits → continue to the open-web flow below.

**When the chosen handler ships `modelConstraints`, copy each constraint into the spec body as a concrete requirement.** Reading them from the manifest at planning time and then "remembering" them at card.js-write time is not enough — by then the manifest detail has rolled out of attention. The constraints have to live in the spec, durably. Specifically:

- `maxImageDimensionPx: 1568` → **handled server-side by Mica automatically** — do NOT add a client-side resize step in card.js. The spec can note this for human reviewers: *"Image resize is enforced server-side by the llm-direct handler; oversized images are downscaled before forwarding to the model."*
- `maxImagesPerTurn: 4` → spec body: *"Max 4 images per turn. Cards that accumulate images across calls must use `history: 'stateless'` at openChannel."*
- `supportedImageFormats: [jpeg, png, webp]` → spec body: *"Accepted formats: JPEG / PNG / WebP. Reject other formats with a clear error."*
- `notes: "<text>"` → copy the notes verbatim into the spec's "Channel handling" or "Image handling" section.

**Why constraints are spec material, not implementation detail**: the spec is what the user reviews and approves. If a resize requirement (or token cap, or format restriction) isn't in the spec, (a) the user can't catch the omission at the approval gate, and (b) the card.js implementation may silently violate the constraint, producing runtime errors the user only sees after the build is shipped.

**The failure mode this catches**: agent reaches for a heavyweight in-browser ML bundle when `mica.openChannel('turn', { model: '<vision-model>', history: 'stateless' })` does the same job in one line. Same anti-pattern for chat (use `llm-direct` instead of a self-hosted JS client), subprocess wraps (use the `process` handler — `child_process` from card.js doesn't work), speech (use the voice sidecars instead of bundling a speech library).

## Step 0a — What do you already know? (recall before search)

**Before any `tavily_search` or `web_fetch`, state out loud what you already know about each subproblem.** You are a coding model trained on a vast corpus of public code, READMEs, and API documentation. For common needs — well-known CDN libraries, asset hosts, public APIs — your training prior is the cheapest source: zero tokens, zero wall clock, zero round trips. Tavily costs ~600-1500 tokens per result × N results, permanently in context. Recall is free.

Write a short recall paragraph in your thinking, one per subproblem. The shape of a good recall paragraph:

- **Library**: name the package, the version line you trust, the canonical CDN URL pattern (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<dist-path>`), the global it exposes, and whether addons are UMD or ESM-only.
- **Asset**: name a CORS-enabled host that serves the file kind you need (a GitHub-served mirror via jsdelivr, a project's `examples/` directory, a known CDN), and the URL pattern.
- **Asset (hard host)**: if the host uses unguessable paths (content-addressed hashes, signed URLs), name its lookup API instead of guessing the file URL.
- **Service**: name the canonical endpoint, the auth requirement, and whether browser CORS is supported.

**The decision tree**, per subproblem:

1. **Strong prior** (you can state the exact URL or API call) → verify with **one** `mica_inspect_url` / `curl` / API call. If 200 + right shape → commit. Skip web search entirely.
2. **Pattern prior** (you know the host's URL shape but not the exact path) → construct a candidate URL and verify with one call. If 200 → commit. If 404, try the host's listing API (`data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/<pkg>`, `api.github.com/repos/<o>/<r>/contents/<path>`, MediaWiki API) — that's still one call, not a search.
3. **Category prior only** (you know the kind of resource needed but no host/URL) → fall through to web search, capped per the budget rule below.
4. **No prior** (truly novel) → web search.

**For asset hosts especially: prefer the host's API over generic web search.** Wikimedia, jsdelivr, GitHub, npm, and most CDN/registry hosts have APIs that return canonical URLs in a single structured call. Searching the open web for "find me the URL of file X on host Y" is the wrong shape — the host already exposes that exact query.

The agent failure shape this prevents: many tavily searches against a host whose direct file URLs use unguessable paths (content-addressed hashes, signed paths), when the host already exposes a lookup API that returns the canonical URL in one structured call.

## Search budget per subproblem

**Cap: 3 web searches (`tavily_search` + `web_fetch` combined) per subproblem.** Searches are the most expensive lookup tool: each one burns ~600-1500 tokens of permanent context per result, and the failure mode "keep iterating query phrasing" wastes the budget without converging.

If your 3rd search hasn't yielded a working URL or endpoint, **STOP searching** and escalate in this order:

1. **Reflect on host APIs.** Did your searches return pages on a specific host (a wiki, a code-host, an npm registry)? That host almost certainly has an API that returns canonical URLs directly. One API call beats N searches.
2. **Drop the resource.** If 3 searches haven't surfaced a working URL, the resource may not be CORS-friendly, may not have a direct URL, or may not exist as a free public resource. Pick a fallback (a simpler placeholder, stub data instead of a live API) and document the substitution in the spec.
3. **Ask the user.** "I can't find a working URL for X. Do you have a preferred source?" One round-trip is cheaper than 10 more searches AND surfaces user-side knowledge Mica can't access (an internal mirror, a known CDN, a license-already-paid asset library).

**Anti-pattern: iterating query phrasing past the cap.** Adding quotes, swapping resolution or size keywords, appending `site:<host>`, dropping a word — these are not new searches, they're the same search with cosmetic variation. If recall + verify + 3 searches haven't surfaced the URL, the next 10 won't either. Escalate.

## Tool choice — pick by content shape

Two real costs on each external call: **wall clock** (how long the tool takes) and **context bloat** (how much of the response sits in chat history for the rest of the session). The cheapest tool depends on the response shape.

**Tool naming gotcha.** `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` is the actual registered name — the bare `tavily_search` returns "tool not found." Pass `max_results: 5` as a **number** (not the string `"5"` — the MCP schema rejects string values with a "tool not available" error).

| Content shape | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Structured JSON (npm registry, jsdelivr listings, GitHub API) | `curl -s ... \| head -c N` | Already structured; small response; grep-friendly. |
| Plain markdown (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/*.md) | `curl -sL ... \| head -c 8000` | Dense; low cruft; scan directly with no LLM round-trip. |
| Single-fact URL verification (format, status, methods) | `mica_inspect_url` | ~500B structured JSON regardless of source size; the body bytes never enter chat history. |
| Finding a thing you don't know (plugin name, free-tier API) | `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` (max_results: 5) | Returns title + snippet + URL per result; cap to 5 for context budget. |
| HTML page with structure (docs sites, blog posts, READMEs, plugins pages, multi-answer SO threads) | `web_fetch` with a SPECIFIC prompt | 30-90 sec for a README or plugins page; few minutes for a long blog post. **Only the extracted answer enters context** — saves 50KB+ of nav/sidebar/footer from permanent history. |

**`web_fetch` is the right tool for documentation pages with structure.** It downloads a page AND routes it through an LLM with your `prompt:` field, returning only the extracted answer — typically ~200 chars regardless of whether the source was 5KB or 200KB. Wallclock scales with page size: a README or plugins page is 30-90 sec; a long blog post or multi-answer thread is a few minutes. Still cheaper than 10 tavily iterations on the same question — both on wallclock and on context cost (each tavily result drops ~600-1500 tokens into history permanently).

That's a net win when:

- The page is a library README or plugins index and you want the install snippet or a curated list of candidates (this is the most common build-time case — see step 3a below).
- The page is HTML with lots of cruft (nav, sidebar, footer, embedded scripts) and your question targets one paragraph.
- The page is long-form prose (RFC, multi-answer SO thread, lengthy changelog) and curl would dump it all into permanent context.

It's a net loss when:

- The response is small JSON (npm/jsdelivr — use curl).
- You need bytes verification of one URL's format/status — use `mica_inspect_url`.

**The rule of thumb**: if you have a library name and want its canonical CDN URL OR a list of plugins, `web_fetch` is almost always the right call. The wall-clock cost (30 sec to a few minutes) reliably beats the context cost of multiple tavily iterations on the same question.

## Search craft — query construction, pivots, and escalation

The Search budget caps you at 3 queries per subproblem. Each query should
drive a different intent dimension. The shape that works across categories:

**One intent per query.** Asset / library / service discovery has three
intent dimensions:

- **SOURCE** — *who/where* the resource lives (Wikimedia? npm? GitHub topic?)
- **FILE / ARTIFACT** — *what* specific resource within the source
- **VERIFICATION** — *whether* the URL works for the runtime use case

Run them sequentially. Each query targets one dimension.

### Query templates

**Library by capability** (one query, often enough):

```
<capability> <ecosystem> plugin
day night terminator leaflet plugin
spatial index 2d points javascript library
```

**Asset, source unknown** (two queries):

```
# 1. source identification — what + likely host
earth texture equirectangular wikimedia commons

# 2. file location — site-restricted
site:commons.wikimedia.org earth daymap equirectangular 8k
```

**Service / free API** (one query):

```
<service-type> public free API CORS no-auth
weather forecast public free API CORS no-auth
geocoding public free API CORS no-auth
```

**Documentation lookup for a known library** — use `web_fetch` against the
library's docs URL with a `prompt:` field instead of tavily. Wallclock
30-90s; one return chunk replaces 5+ tavily iterations.

### Pivot strategies — apply after two queries return generic results

Each strategy yields a candidate URL that flows back into `mica_inspect_url`
for verification.

- **Category / topic page** — Wikimedia `Category:`, GitHub `topic:`. One
  fetch returns a curated list of candidates.
- **Library examples folder** — When the work uses a library, read its own
  `examples/` directory. The library knows which assets it ships with and
  where they live.
- **Tutorial copy** — A working tutorial that uses the same asset class has
  verified URLs in its source. Read the source, take the URL, verify, commit.
- **Host's listing API** — `data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/...`,
  `api.github.com/repos/.../contents/...`. The host already knows every
  file; the listing returns them all in one call.

### Escalation when the budget is exhausted

After three queries without a canonical candidate, surface the state to the
user with `user_question`. Give them:

1. The candidates you found and rejected, with the rejection reason for each.
2. A specific question naming the resource gap.

Example escalation:

```
I searched for {asset}. Found three candidates:
- {url-1}: rejected because {reason}
- {url-2}: rejected because {reason}
- {url-3}: rejected because {reason}

What I need: {specific shape — content type, CORS, license, host
constraint}. Do you have a preferred source, or should I proceed with
{fallback option}?
```

The user redirects from a position of seeing the agent's work.

### How this relates to the Search budget

Search budget is the WHEN (cap at 3); search craft is the HOW. Each of the
three queries should be a different shape — one for source, one for file,
one for verification or pivot input. Three queries with the same shape
indicate the agent reformulating instead of advancing.

## The one universal rule (with self-check)

**Any URL you write into a spec, a card's `metadata.json`, or `card.html` / `card.js` MUST have been verified with `mica_inspect_url` THIS TURN first.** Not last turn. Not from memory. Not from a tavily snippet. Not from a README quote. THIS TURN. No exceptions. This includes:

- URLs you recalled from training and feel confident about.
- URLs you derived from a jsdelivr file listing (the listing tells you what files *exist* in the package; only `mica_inspect_url` confirms the exact path renders 200, has the right format, and exposes the methods you'll call).
- URLs you got from a tavily search result or web_fetch'd page.
- URLs you modified (changed version, swapped `/dist/`, added `.min`, removed `.min`). A modified URL is a NEW URL — `mica_inspect_url` it again before commit.

### Self-check before `write_file` on the spec

Before calling `write_file` on `canvas/<class>-spec.md`, list each URL that will appear in the frontmatter's `dependencies.umd_scripts` and `dependencies.styles` arrays, alongside its `mica_inspect_url` result this turn:

```
URL                                                              Verified this turn?
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<path>              ✓ UMD, 200
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<owner>/<repo>@<ref>/<path>          ✓ data, 200, CORS *
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<addon-path>        ✗ NOT inspect_url'd this turn
```

If ANY row shows ✗, the spec is incomplete. Either inspect the URL now (one call, ~500 bytes, ~200ms) or remove it from the spec. Tavily snippets, README text, and your training prior are NOT verification — they might describe a URL that 404s, ships ESM instead of UMD, or serves the wrong content type. Only a same-turn `mica_inspect_url` confirms the URL works in card.js's classic-script context.

This rule exists because URL construction is where hallucination compounds silently. The agent recalls `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<ver>/<path>` correctly in shape but guesses the path component, writes it into the spec, and the build phase commits a 404. **The cost of one `mica_inspect_url` call (~500 bytes, ~200ms) is trivial against the cost of a wrong URL surfacing as a runtime failure during build.** Observed failure shape: spec lands with unverified URL → `mica_create_class`'s `enforceDependenciesReachable` validator catches it OR the build fails at first render → agent re-researches from scratch in the build turn → ~10+ extra tool calls + several minutes of wallclock that one inspect_url call in the planning turn would have prevented.

If `mica_inspect_url` returns `ok: false`, that URL does not ship. Use the `reason` field's pivot suggestion (usually the jsdelivr listing) to find a real path, then `mica_inspect_url` the real one before writing it anywhere. If the inspect returns `format: 'ESM'` when you wanted UMD, see `_conventions.md § "Latest stable + bridge gaps"` — the bridge is Pattern B for that URL, not a walk-back to an older version.

### Pick and proceed; ask when stuck

The user reviews specs before the build runs. If a choice is wrong, they redirect — changing a draft spec is cheap. **One verification is enough; one plausible choice is enough.** When you find yourself re-inspecting or re-searching the same thing, take one of two exits: **(1) commit** the spec with your best choice, or **(2) ask** the user a specific question. Looping, bailing out, or claiming the user's input is incomplete are wrong exits.

## Procedure — enumerate, classify, walk

### Step 1 — Enumerate subproblems

In your thinking / scratch space, list every recognizable subproblem this build has. Be specific:

- Vague: "render the visualization"
- Specific: name each distinct visual primitive, animation type, asset, and computation as its own subproblem.

Subproblems that involve plain DOM-glue or trivial JS (a single button, a small static array, simple state) are NOT subproblems for this skill — skip them. Subproblems that compute, format, transform, render, animate, parse, talk to a service, or load bytes ARE subproblems.

### Step 2 — Classify each subproblem

For each one, tag it:

| Tag | What | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **library** | Need executable JS code | Core visual primitives (rendering engines, chart libraries, map libraries, markdown renderers), AND plugins on top of those for distinct sub-features — overlays, controls, layout modes — that ship as their own package. |
| **asset** | Need a file (image/audio/video/font/model/data) | Textures, hero images, avatars, background music, custom fonts, data files. |
| **service** | Need a live endpoint | Weather, stock, map tile servers, geocoding, currency rates. |
| **bespoke** | None of the above; write custom code | Trivial DOM glue, small static data arrays, one-line wrappers around browser built-ins. **Math or geometry that has an established library on the open ecosystem is NOT bespoke — it's a library subproblem you haven't searched yet.** |

**Before classifying as `library`: check for a browser built-in.** A class of common needs has native browser APIs that are typically a one-liner. Preferring them avoids the entire library hunt and the bundle/version/loading complexity that follows:

| Need | Browser native | Common over-reach |
|---|---|---|
| Time zones / locale-aware formatting | `Intl.DateTimeFormat({ timeZone, ... })`, `toLocaleString(locale, opts)` | moment + moment-timezone, date-fns-tz, luxon |
| Number / currency formatting | `Intl.NumberFormat` | numeral.js |
| Date math (basic) | `Date`, `Date.now()`, `+` arithmetic, `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` | moment, dayjs (for simple needs) |
| Locale-aware string sort | `Intl.Collator` | lodash sortBy with custom comparator |
| Crypto / hashing | `crypto.subtle.digest`, `crypto.randomUUID()` | js-sha256, crypto-js, uuid |
| Animation frame loop | `requestAnimationFrame` | gsap (for non-tween uses) |
| Local persistence | `localStorage`, `IndexedDB` | external KV stores |
| URL parsing / construction | `new URL(...)` | url libs |
| Element observation | `IntersectionObserver`, `ResizeObserver`, `MutationObserver` | scroll/resize event listeners + libraries |
| Clipboard | `navigator.clipboard.writeText/readText` | clipboard.js |

**The rule**: if a need has a 5-line native solution, tag it `bespoke` ("uses built-in browser API"), not `library`. A 100-300KB external library wrapping a one-liner is a tax in download size, version pinning, bundle-variant selection, and script-loading order — for no functional gain. Card.js runs in a real browser; modern APIs are available.

**Symmetric rule for the opposite mistake — bespoke gate.** Before tagging any subproblem as `bespoke` *for any reason other than "5-line browser-native solution exists"*, you MUST have completed a recall + at-least-one-search pass for a library that solves it. The shape to watch for is the thought "*this could be a library, or I could compute it myself*" — that's the exact moment to STOP and search, not the moment to default to "compute it myself." Reasons this is the dominant failure mode:

- The agent's training corpus contains many examples of "here is the math formula for X," which makes a from-scratch implementation feel reachable.
- A specialized library that solves X often has a smaller training footprint than the math formula, so the formula path feels MORE familiar than the library does — recall is biased toward bespoke even when a library would be far cleaner.
- "I can do it in N lines" is a recall claim, not a verified one. Until you've actually typed the N lines AND debugged them, the real cost is unknown. The library you haven't searched for might be 1 line.

**Gate**: if your draft classification table has any `bespoke` row whose subproblem is NOT in the browser-native table above (Intl, crypto.subtle, requestAnimationFrame, etc.), go run `mcp__tavily__tavily_search "<feature> <ecosystem-or-host-library> plugin"` or equivalent recall+verify for the library candidate BEFORE finalizing the classification. The spec/decisions table can land on `bespoke` legitimately — but only after a search rejected the library option, and the rejection reason is recorded.

### Step 2a — Library inclusion test (two gates)

Step 0 and the Step 2 bespoke-gate prevent the "compute it myself" failure
mode by forcing a library search before tagging as bespoke. They do not
prevent the symmetric failure: pulling in a library — or a submodule of a
library you've already included — that the spec doesn't actually need.
Loading-pattern complexity (UMD vs ESM submodules, bare-specifier resolution,
metadata.scripts coherence) is real cost; every avoided library is one less
loop the build can get stuck in.

Before finalizing a `LIBRARY` tag (or adding a submodule to a library
already included), apply two gates in order:

**Gate 1 — User-intent gate.** Include only features the user's prompt
explicitly names. For every feature in the spec, you should be able to quote
the word or phrase in the prompt that requires it. Features the prompt does
not name belong in SKIP rows of the decision table, with the literal-prompt
audit annotation. The user redirects via their next message if a SKIP'd
feature should be included — one redirect costs less than five turns of
metadata reconciliation.

**Training-prior fills these tend to surface on similar prompts. Run the
literal-scan to keep them filtered:**

| Prompt mentions… | Training prior fills in… | Gate 1 verdict (literal-scan) |
|---|---|---|
| 3D scene, 3D animation, 3D visualization | OrbitControls (mouse-drag camera) | SKIP — the prompt names passive viewing; interaction needs an explicit word like "explorable" or "interactive" |
| Chart, graph, plot | Pan/zoom controls | SKIP — chart prompts default to static |
| Form, input | Progress indicator, autosave indicator | SKIP — explicit "save automatically" triggers inclusion |
| Editor, canvas | Undo/redo, history panel | SKIP — history needs an explicit named behavior |
| List, table, grid | Sort/filter UI | SKIP — sortable/filterable is explicit |
| Map | Layer controls, search bar, zoom UI | SKIP — bare "map" means tiles + markers |

When in doubt, write a SKIP row and let the user pull features in. SKIP rows
are visible in the spec; the user can redirect any of them by name.

**Gate 2 — Verifiability gate.** For a subproblem that IS in scope, ask:
*Can the correctness of its output be judged from the rendered screenshot
alone, using the Playwright live-mount loop (`render_capture`)?*

- **YES** → INLINE is viable. The verification loop self-corrects: if the
  inline implementation is wrong, the screenshot shows it, and iteration
  repairs it. Inline cost (small code addition) is less than library cost
  (loading pattern, version compat, metadata coherence).
- **NO** → LIBRARY is justified. The library encodes domain knowledge
  (astronomical geometry, geographic projection, layout algorithms,
  cryptographic operations) the verification loop cannot see. Without it,
  the agent would have to recreate the same domain code to grade its own
  output — defeating the purpose.

**Worked examples:**

| Subproblem | Verifiable from screenshot? | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Mouse-drag-to-rotate camera | YES (drags or doesn't) | INLINE — or SKIP if not in prompt |
| Orbital animation around a center | YES (object moves in a circle) | INLINE — `requestAnimationFrame` + trig |
| Procedural starfield | YES (stars visible, count plausible) | INLINE — `Points` + `BufferGeometry` |
| Texture loading onto a sphere | YES (sphere shows texture or not) | Core library only — no submodule needed |
| Day/night terminator on a 2D map | NO (curve looks plausible at every wrong position) | LIBRARY — `leaflet-terminator` |
| Mercator/Web-Mercator tile projection | NO (a few pixels off is invisible) | LIBRARY — `leaflet` |
| Time-zone abbreviation lookup | YES (label says "EST" correctly or not) | INLINE — `Intl.DateTimeFormat` |
| Drag-and-drop with grid snapping | YES (snaps to grid or doesn't) | INLINE if simple; LIBRARY if elastic |
| GLTF / GLB model loading | NO (model loads correctly or not from a binary format) | LIBRARY — `three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader` |

**One-line decision criterion:** if the screenshot a user would see is
*enough to catch incorrectness*, the iteration loop covers you and inline is
cheaper. If the screenshot would look plausible even when the math is wrong,
the library encodes the verification you don't have.

**Decision table row format** when a library was rejected in favor of inline:

`Subproblem | LIBRARY | INLINE — verifiable by render_capture (N lines) | <reason>`

The `INLINE — verifiable by render_capture (N lines)` annotation is the
audit trail for skipping a library: the next reviewer can see at a glance
that the inline path was deliberate, not a "compute it myself" oversight.

**Skip rationale row format** when a feature was excluded by gate 1:

`<feature> | SKIP | not in user request — training-prior default | <one-line context>`

That row gives the user a single place to redirect ("actually add
OrbitControls") rather than discovering the omission post-build.

### Step 3 — Walk each tagged subproblem through the matching procedure

**Enumerate candidates first.** For each subproblem (especially library / plugin / service ones), write down 3–5 candidate options — mix kinds where relevant (a library plus a bespoke fallback). Recall-first; `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` (max_results: 5) only when recall genuinely fails for a category. Don't pre-filter to your favorite — list alternatives even if you wouldn't pick them. The candidate space becomes visible to the user when you record it on canvas (Step 4), so they can redirect *before* you commit to one.

**Pick on positive fit, not elimination.** Once 2–3 candidates pass the tech-bar (UMD-loadable, CORS-clean — Step 3a-3c verification), choose using **positive signals**, not "the one I have more training data on":

- **Native feature match** (highest weight). Search prior art: `<library> <feature>`. If candidate A has a plugin or built-in that solves your specific sub-feature in one line and candidate B requires writing it from scratch, A wins regardless of which library you recall better.
- **Prior art density**. Search `"<exact use case>" site:github.com stars:>20`, or `<use case> <library> example codepen`. Lots of working examples = well-trodden path = less debug time. A smaller-star library where many repos solve your exact use case beats a bigger-star library where no one has done it.
- **User-facing quality**. For visible UI (maps, charts, image viewers, 3D scenes): prefer libraries that ship pre-built visual primitives over libraries that hand you a blank canvas and require you to assemble the look yourself, even when the latter is technically capable. The output should feel like the modern web, not a textbook diagram.
- **Plugin ecosystem breadth**. Quick `<library> plugins` or `<library> awesome list` search. Many plugins = many of your future needs (interactivity, animation, time controls, data overlays) are already someone's solved problem.

**Discard ONLY for hard blockers**, not for unfamiliarity: not UMD-compatible (won't load via `<script>`), confirmed hard CORS issue, genuinely abandoned (no commits in 5+ years, no recent published versions). *"I have less training data on this one"* is **not** a hard blocker — that's exactly what Mica's curated `<library>-skills` packs exist for. Use `mica_list_skill_packages` and `mica_install_skills` to load the missing context BEFORE rejecting a candidate.

**Sequence the work**: positive-fit search FIRST (cheap; one or two tavily/curl calls), then tech-verify the leading candidate (`mica_inspect_url`). Don't run `mica_inspect_url` on every candidate's URLs before you've decided which one fits — that's the elimination-first failure mode that wastes tool calls verifying candidates you'll discard for non-tech reasons anyway.

#### 3a — LIBRARY subproblems

Recall-first. You're a coding model with a large training corpus. For any library that appears in public code thousands of times, **you already know**: canonical package name, known-stable version range, CDN URL shape, whether addons are UMD or ESM-only, the one-line "hello world" call. Surface that recall before reaching for search.

**Two canonical first moves when recall alone doesn't give you the URL.** These compress what's otherwise 10+ tavily iterations into 1-2 web_fetch calls. Reach for them before tavily.

**Move 1 — you have a library name but not the canonical CDN URL.** The README is the source of truth: the maintainer documents the recommended `<script>` tag URL there. One call:

```
web_fetch({
  url: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/README.md",
  // or the GitHub repo URL if the README is mostly elsewhere
  prompt: "What's the recommended CDN URL for using this library via a <script> tag? Include the exact URL, version, and any required CSS."
})
```

Returns the install snippet directly. Pair with one `mica_inspect_url` on the returned URL to verify, then commit it to the spec. Two calls total, not ten search iterations.

**Move 2 — you need a plugin or addon for a known library.** Most popular UI libraries maintain a canonical ecosystem page that lists vetted community plugins, categorized by feature. Examples of where to look:

- The library's official docs site, under "Plugins" / "Ecosystem" / "Addons" (`<library>.org/plugins.html` or similar).
- The library's GitHub wiki (`github.com/<owner>/<repo>/wiki/Plugins`).
- An "awesome-<library>" curated list on GitHub.

One call:

```
web_fetch({
  url: "<plugins index URL>",
  prompt: "List plugins related to <sub-feature>, with their GitHub URLs and short descriptions."
})
```

The maintainer has already filtered out dead/broken/obscure options — you get a curated shortlist. Pick one, `mica_inspect_url` the chosen plugin's CDN URL to verify, commit.

**Why these two moves first.** They mirror how a human developer actually finds libraries — piggy-backing on someone else's curation (the README install snippet, the plugins index) rather than reconstructing the universe via raw web search. Raw tavily search of URL variants is the slow path. README and plugins-page are the fast paths.

Tavily is still the right primitive for genuinely novel discovery — *what category of solution exists for an unfamiliar problem*. Once you have a library NAME, switch to web_fetch on the README; once you have a parent library and want one of its plugins, switch to web_fetch on its plugins page.

For each library subproblem:

1. **Recall**: library name, known-stable version, CDN URL `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<dist-path>`, addon ESM/UMD status, one-line API call.
2. **Install library-specific skill if curated, then read it**: `mica_install_skills source="<library>-skills"`. Mica's curated table maps well-known library names to vetted repos. Installs instantly with no gate. **Installation alone does NOT put the content in context — after install, `list_directory .qwen/skills/<library>/skills/` and `read_file` each `SKILL.md` before authoring any code that uses the library.** Library-specific skills carry knowledge the base model misses — disposer patterns, init-order quirks, version-specific gotchas. A common failure mode: agent installs the pack, assumes content is now "available," then improvises orchestration (load-N-then-create flows, scene-graph init order, async-load completion patterns) and gets it wrong. The SKILL.md files inside the pack document these. Do this BEFORE writing any code that uses the library.
3. **Verify** with `mica_inspect_url <CDN URL>`. The tool returns `{ ok, status, contentType, format, methods }` in ~500 bytes — saves chat-history context over raw `curl -s | head`. Read the `format` field:
   - `"UMD"` — browser-loadable as `<script>`. Mark verified.
   - `"ESM"` or `"CommonJS"` — won't load as a classic script in card.js. Mark unverified for browser use; pick a different version or library.
   - `"data"` — JSON/CSS/text. Fine for asset rows.
   - `ok: false` (non-200) — `reason` includes a pivot suggestion. **404 pivot rule**: your next call is `curl -s https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/<pkg>` for the package's file listing — find the real path. Do NOT guess more URL variants.

   For libraries that produce visible UI (maps, charts, image viewers), ALSO fetch the README to find ancillary CSS / font / data dependencies: `curl -s https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/README.md | head -c 8000` and scan the first quickstart HTML example for `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags. Add each ancillary URL as a separate verified row (run `mica_inspect_url` on it too). Missing an ancillary CSS file is a silent-failure mode — the library loads, the API is defined, but the visible output renders blank because layout styles never load.

   Raw `curl -sI -L | head -1` is fine when you just want a status code; `mica_inspect_url` is the default for any dependency you're about to commit to `metadata.json`.
4. **Search only if recall fails**: `mcp__tavily__tavily_search "<problem> javascript library"` (max_results: 5) — for genuinely niche libraries you don't recognize.

**Library structured-data sources** (curl wins here — 200ms structured JSON, no LLM round-trip):

```bash
# Latest version + main entry path
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>" | head -c 4000

# Every file in the published tarball (for non-default dist paths)
curl -s "https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/<pkg>" | head -c 2000
```

### Library → read → use (lookup-first, not recall-first)

You don't remember CDN URLs. You remember **library names**. The flow mirrors what a human does: name the library, read its current state, then use what you read. Training memorizes URL *shapes* well (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<v>/...` doesn't change) but not specific *paths* or *versions* — paths get renamed across releases, and versions advance faster than the training corpus. Lookup-first is two deterministic curls (~400ms) that eliminate both stale axes at once.

**Step 0 — Resolve the npm package name.** For popular libraries with unambiguous names (`three`, `leaflet`, `d3`, `react`, `chart.js`, `mermaid`), recall is reliable — skip this step. For scoped, modular, renamed, or unfamiliar packages (BabylonJS → `@babylonjs/core`; D3 modular → `d3-selection` etc.), one npm search returns the canonical name:

```bash
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=<common-name>&size=5" | head -c 4000
```

Self-check: if Step 1's package lookup returns 404 or an obviously-wrong package, your recall was wrong — go back and run Step 0.

**Step 1 — Look up the package.** One call gives you the latest version AND every file the package ships. *(Use the jsdelivr listing below — it's deterministic. Structured JSON cannot hallucinate. Do not ask a search-style tool for "the ESM filename for package X" — those return prose that often picks a plausible-but-wrong path, e.g. the historical UMD `three.min.js` when the ESM file is `three.module.js`.)*

```bash
curl -s "https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/<pkg>" | head -c 4000
# → tags.latest, versions[]

curl -s "https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/<pkg>@<latest>" | head -c 4000
# → file tree at that version
```

The file-tree names tell you the shipping format upfront — no guessing:

| File you see | Format |
|---|---|
| `build/*.umd.js`, `dist/*.min.js` (no `.module`) | UMD ships |
| `build/*.module.js`, `index.mjs`, `*.esm.js` | ESM ships |
| Both kinds present | Library ships both (transitional; either pattern works — pick UMD if simpler) |
| Only `*.module.js` / `*.mjs` | **ESM-only.** Architecture is Pattern B. No walk-back. |

**Step 2 — Read the README quickstart** (for libraries with visible output: UI, charts, maps, 3D, etc.):

```bash
curl -s "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<latest>/README.md" | head -c 8000
```

The first quickstart block has the URL the library's *own docs* recommend, plus the canonical usage call (`new THREE.Scene()`, `L.map(...)`, etc.). Use that URL — it's what the maintainers ship today. The README also surfaces ancillary deps (CSS, fonts) the file-tree alone wouldn't reveal.

**Step 3 — `mica_inspect_url` the URL you found** to confirm 200 + format. The URL came from the package's own listing or README, not training memory — the inspect is a sanity check, not the source of truth. If the library has addons you'll use, inspect each addon URL at the same version too.

**Step 4 — Apply the matching load pattern** (mechanics documented in `card-class-handbook § "Pattern A — UMD"` and `§ "Pattern B — Dynamic ES module import"`):

- **Core ships UMD** → Pattern A (UMD URL in `metadata.scripts`, library exposed as a global)
- **Core ships ESM** → Pattern B (`metadata.scripts: []`, `await import(url)` inline; prefer the `/+esm` variant per § The bare-specifier trap below)
- **Core UMD + addons ESM** (common Three.js / Leaflet-plugins / D3-addons shape) → Pattern A for core + Pattern B for each addon, same card. Mixed-format integration is normal, not an edge case — but see § The bare-specifier trap.

card.js runs as a classic script (the runtime wrapper does not make it a module), so a static `import` keyword throws. Use `await import(url)` (dynamic import) for Pattern B — works inside the wrapper's async function.

**Walk-back is never the next move.** If you find yourself typing a different version number for the same library after a 404 or after seeing ESM format, you're guessing instead of looking up. Stop and run Step 1 — the listing tells you the version *and* the actual paths in one response. Version walk-back is what produced the bare-specifier trap that bit prior builds.

#### The bare-specifier trap (mixed-format gotcha)

`mica_inspect_url` verifies the URL responds 200 and the file is the format it claims to be. It does **not** parse the file's import graph. The most common runtime failure with mixed-format integration:

> An ESM addon (e.g. `OrbitControls.js`) contains `import * as THREE from 'three';` — a bare specifier. The browser cannot resolve `'three'` without an import map. `await import(addonUrl)` throws `Failed to resolve module specifier 'three'` at runtime, even though `inspect_url` showed `200, ESM, OrbitControls export`.

**Before you ship mixed format**, do one of the following:

1. **Use the auto-bundling ESM variant** — jsdelivr serves `/+esm` URLs that rewrite bare specifiers to full URLs:
   ```
   https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@<v>/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js/+esm
   ```
   Inspect this URL; if format is ESM and the response doesn't contain a bare `import ... from 'three'`, you're safe.
2. **Go full ESM** — drop the UMD core, load both the core and the addon as ESM via `await import()`. Resolves the same bare specifier because the same `+esm` rewriter applies.
3. **Inline import map** — write a `<script type="importmap">` block in card.html mapping `'three'` to the full Three.js ESM CDN URL. Card-author overhead is real; prefer option 1.

**To detect the trap before the build**, after `mica_inspect_url` confirms the addon URL is ESM, `web_fetch` the same URL with `prompt:"does this file contain any bare-specifier imports — lines like 'import ... from \"<package-name>\"' where the package name has no scheme or path?"` (or `mica_shell` with `curl -s <url> | grep -E "^import.*from '[a-z]"`). If the answer is yes and the URL is not a `/+esm` variant, you have the trap — pick option 1, 2, or 3 above and document the choice in the spec's verified-dependencies table.

**Don't reach for these as defaults:**

- **Walking back versions** to find a single version where everything is UMD. That combination was discontinued years ago for most popular library families; the walk burns 5-10 tool calls confirming what the first two `mica_inspect_url` calls already told you.
- **Community UMD wrappers** (e.g. `<lib>-umd`, often sub-1.0 versioned, often one-maintainer) — they bundle a frozen library version, add a supply-chain hop, and lag upstream releases. Pattern B is the supported ESM path; use the wrapper only when Pattern B has a specific blocker.

**Escape valves** (rare — for libraries that genuinely can't load either UMD or ESM cleanly):

- Read the library's README for an alternative CDN path the npm registry doesn't advertise.
- Check the jsdelivr file listing (`curl -s https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/<pkg>`) for `.umd.js` / `.iife.js` paths.
- Go bespoke with documented rationale (spec must list which alternatives were tried).

See `_conventions.md § "Latest stable + bridge gaps"` for the cross-skill version of this rule.

#### 3b — ASSET subproblems

**Asset URL Extract Pattern — search, extract, verify:**

After Search craft surfaces a likely description page or canonical host for
an asset, resolve the direct asset URL with one of these generic tools — no
per-host API knowledge required:

1. **`tavily_extract`** with `include_images: true` on a description page
   URL. Returns a list of direct image URLs extracted from the page. Works
   for Wikimedia file description pages (the `commons/<x>/<xy>/<filename>`
   hash subdirectory pops out in the `images` array), GitHub README rendered
   pages, dev.to articles, library example pages — anywhere images appear
   on an HTML page.

   ```json
   {
     "urls": ["https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solarsystemscope_texture_2k_moon.jpg"],
     "include_images": true
   }
   ```

   Returns: `{ results: [{ url, raw_content, images: [<direct image URLs>] }] }`.
   Filter the `images` array for the file you want, then verify each
   candidate with `mica_inspect_url`.

2. **`mcp__tavily__tavily_search` with a site-restricted query** —
   add `site:commons.wikimedia.org` (or whichever host you suspect)
   into the query string. Returns matching pages limited to that
   host; pick the top result and run `tavily_extract` on it to pull
   the direct file URLs:

   ```json
   {
     "query": "Solarsystemscope moon texture site:commons.wikimedia.org",
     "max_results": 5
   }
   ```

The pattern replaces per-host API knowledge with one generic mechanism.
Tavily extract + site-restricted search covers Wikimedia (no need for
the MediaWiki API), GitHub asset pages (no need for the GitHub contents
API when the asset is referenced on a README), Three.js examples folder,
and similar HTML-page-referenced asset sources.

For *content-addressed library packages* (npm via jsdelivr, GitHub via
jsdelivr/gh), the existing Step 3a Library section already documents
`data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/...` listing — keep using that. The extract
pattern above is for *description pages* (HTML pages referencing assets),
not for package contents.

**When to reach for the extract pattern** depends on the calibration
block at the top of the runtime banner:
- If `recallProfile.assetUrlPaths` is **very-low** for the running model:
  skip recall entirely and use the extract pattern from the start.
- If `assetUrlPaths` is **low**: recall + verify first; advance to the
  extract pattern only if `mica_inspect_url` rejects the recalled URL.
- If `assetUrlPaths` is **medium** or **high**: recall + verify covers
  most cases. The extract pattern remains the fallback for verification
  failures.

The CORS-friendly host shapes table below documents URL formats for
constructing candidate URLs by recall (when the model class supports it).



| Asset category | URL shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Any GitHub-hosted asset (jsdelivr-served) | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<owner>/<repo>@<ref>/<path>` | CORS `*`, edge-cached, fast. **The `@<ref>` is required** — the no-`@` form returns 403. Pin a commit, tag, or branch with `@`. |
| Any GitHub-hosted asset (direct) | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<ref>/<path>` | CORS `*`; slower than jsdelivr (no edge cache) but simpler URL. |
| Any npm-hosted asset | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<path>` | CORS `*`; works for any file in an npm tarball. |
| Library's own examples directory | look for `examples/` on the library's GitHub repo; serve via jsdelivr-gh or raw.githubusercontent | Pin to a release tag for stability. |
| Public CDN-hosted font service | check the service's documented CSS URL pattern | Usually CORS-friendly and works with standard `@import` or `<link rel="stylesheet">`. |

**Many hosts that serve image bytes do NOT send CORS headers, so the asset 200s in a fetch but fails as a WebGL texture / canvas drawImage source.** The failure shape: the sphere or surface renders as solid color, no console error. Mitigation: for any asset used in WebGL / canvas / SubresourceIntegrity, verify CORS during step 2 below. If a needed asset's source doesn't send CORS, find a GitHub mirror and serve it through jsdelivr-gh.

**Canonical first moves for asset hunting** — these compress what's otherwise dozens of tavily searches into a few inspect_url calls. Reach for them in order; only fall through to tavily when recall genuinely produces no candidate.

**Move 1 — you know the host but not the exact path.** Construct a candidate URL from one of the host shapes above and `mica_inspect_url` it. The tool returns `{ok, status, contentType, format}` in ~500 bytes. If `ok: true`, commit.

**On the FIRST 404 for an asset, your next call is the listing API. Not another filename guess. Not a tavily search.** If you find yourself typing a second filename variant for the same logical asset (e.g. `moon_1k_color.jpg` → `moon_1k.jpg` → `moon.jpg`), you've already broken this rule — stop and list the directory.

```bash
# Every file in a GitHub repo at a given ref:
curl -s "https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/gh/<owner>/<repo>?branch=<ref>" | head -c 4000
# OR (faster when you know the specific subdirectory):
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<subdir>?ref=<ref>" | head -c 4000

# Every file in an npm package at a given version:
curl -s "https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/<pkg>@<version>" | head -c 4000
```

One listing response shows you every file. Pick the right path, `mica_inspect_url` it, commit. Total budget: 2-4 calls per asset, not 20.

**Why the trigger is the FIRST 404, not the third**: recall is often *partially* accurate — sibling assets share most of their name, so the first few candidate URLs hit and reinforce the pattern. When the (N+1)th sibling 404s, the reflex is "the pattern is right; try a variant." But filename renames don't follow patterns. The variant loop burns 5-10 calls before recovery; the listing call ends it in one.

**Move 2 — you know the asset category but not the host.** Recall first. Most popular libraries with visual output ship their example assets in their own GitHub repos at `examples/` — try the library's repo first (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<owner>/<repo>@<tag>/examples/<subpath>`). Many art / texture / font assets live in well-known curated repos; if you can name a candidate repo, try it as Move 1.

**Move 3 — genuine no-prior.** `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` with a sharp query naming the category PLUS a host hint (e.g. `"<asset> github jsdelivr cors"` or `"<asset> npm package"`). For asset search specifically, apply the two-step pattern from § Search craft: source identification (what + likely host), then site-restricted file location. Cap at the 3-search rule from § Search budget. After two queries returning generic results, advance to a pivot strategy from § Search craft (category/topic page, library examples, tutorial copy, host listing API) instead of reformulating. If the three-query budget exhausts, escalate via `user_question` with the candidates found and the gap to fill — see § Search craft for the escalation template.

**`mica_inspect_url` verifies URLs; tavily does not.** Once you have a candidate URL — even a low-confidence guess like a jsdelivr-gh path you're not certain exists — `mica_inspect_url` it directly. **Do NOT tavily-search to verify a URL.** Tavily describes pages on the open web; it cannot tell you whether `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<owner>/<repo>@<ref>/<path>` returns 200 with CORS. inspect_url can — the answer is unambiguous in 200ms. The agent's natural reflex of "let me search to see if this URL is real before committing the inspect_url" wastes the search budget — commit the inspect_url. If it 404s, that's a CHEAPER signal than a tavily snippet ("this page seems to exist"), and the next move (file listing) is deterministic.

For each asset subproblem, the procedure:

1. **Recall** a candidate URL using a host shape from the table above, OR a host you remember by name.
2. **`mica_inspect_url` the candidate.** If 200, check `contentType` matches what you need (image/* for textures, font/* for fonts, etc.). If 404, fetch the file listing per Move 1 and pick the real path.
3. **CORS check (only for WebGL / canvas / SubresourceIntegrity use cases)**: `curl -sIL "<url>" -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" 2>&1 | grep -i "access-control-allow-origin"`. Empty output = no CORS; switch to a jsdelivr-gh mirror of the same file.
4. **Search only if recall + listing fail**: `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` per Move 3, capped at 3.

#### 3c — SERVICE subproblems

For each service (live API endpoint) subproblem:

1. **Recall** canonical APIs for the domain — for common categories (weather, geo, map tiles, generic open data), state the host you trust, the URL pattern, and what auth it needs.
2. **Verify** endpoint shape:
   ```bash
   curl -s "<endpoint-with-sample-params>" | head -c 2000
   ```
   Confirm: it returns JSON in the shape you expect; auth requirement is what you thought (no auth, API key in query, bearer token); rate limit is documented.
3. **CORS** for client-side use: `curl -sIL "<endpoint>" -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" | grep -i "access-control-allow-origin"`. Many APIs don't support browser CORS and require a server-side proxy. Mica's `mica.fetch` proxies through the server, bypassing CORS — use it for any third-party API call from card.js.
4. **Search only if recall fails**: `mcp__tavily__tavily_search "<domain> free API CORS"` (max_results: 5).

#### 3d — BESPOKE subproblems

If the subproblem is genuinely small (minimal math, a small static array, simple state), record it as "no dependency — N lines bespoke" and move on. The "no dependency" decision still goes in the spec so reviewers can audit.

### Step 4 — Record decisions on canvas

The decisions MUST land in a canvas file before any code that depends on them ships. Otherwise the next agent (or your next session) has no record of WHY this version / URL / endpoint was chosen and re-derives from scratch — possibly choosing differently. Without a recorded decision, the curl-verification work is real but ephemeral, and the next session may pick a different version of the same library for the same task.

**Where to record** — pick the most appropriate existing file, in this priority order:

1. **`canvas/spec.md` § Subproblems and their solutions** — preferred when a spec.md exists and the build is card-class-shaped. Co-located with the build it informs.
2. **`canvas/decisions.md`** — preferred when the project already has a `decisions.md` file or the decision spans multiple cards.
3. **`canvas/interfaces.md` § Dependency versions** — preferred during decomposed builds via `task-decomposer`; subagents reading the interfaces contract see the pins.
4. **A new `canvas/dependency-decisions.md`** — only if none of the above exist.

**Pick ONE location and stay consistent within a project.**

**Optional but recommended for non-trivial builds (3+ subproblems): also write `canvas/<class>-research.md`** — a canvas-visible artifact enumerating ALL candidates considered (not just the chosen picks), with verified URLs. This is for the *user* to read on canvas BEFORE approving the build, so they can redirect to a different candidate before any code is written. The artifact is not validated by Mica — its format is a suggestion, not a contract — but the canvas-visibility makes the candidate space available for user review. Suggested shape:

```markdown
# Research: <class name>

## Subproblems
1. <subproblem>
2. <subproblem>

## Candidates per subproblem

### 1. <subproblem>
| Option | Type | URL | Verified | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <library-A>@<version> | library | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<path> | 200, UMD | full-featured option |
| <library-A> CSS | asset | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<css-path> | 200, data | required for layout |
| <library-B> | library | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<pkg>@<version>/<path> | 200, UMD | alternative; different trade-offs |
| Bespoke | — | — | ~N lines | hand-roll; only after the candidates above are rejected |

## Suggested stacks
| Stack | Picks |
|---|---|
| <library-A> | (1) core + CSS, (2) plugin for sub-feature X, (3) plugin for sub-feature Y |
| <library-B> | (1) core, (2) alternate plugin for X, (3) alternate plugin for Y |
```

The spec (location 1 above) THEN copies URLs verbatim from research's URL column — never introduce an unverified URL in the spec. Build phase consumes the spec; research is for user review.

**The format is identical regardless of location** — a markdown table with one row per subproblem, ordered by kind:

```markdown
## Subproblems and their solutions

| Subproblem | Kind | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| <core visual primitive> | library | Use `<pkg>@<version>` via `<verified CDN URL>` (curl 200) | <why this candidate won; what plugins/skills are loaded> |
| <sub-feature on top of core> | library | Use `<plugin>@<version>` via `<verified CDN URL>` (curl 200) | <one-line justification; alternatives rejected> |
| <one-shot interaction> | bespoke | <N> lines | <why no library — alternatives considered and rejected> |
| <asset> | asset | `<verified CORS-enabled URL>` (curl 200, CORS `*`) | <host choice rationale> |
| <static config> | bespoke | Static array | Just data, not a dependency. |
```

When recording in `decisions.md` instead of spec.md, prefix the section with the build it informs (e.g. `## Dependency decisions — <class name>`).

## Output shape — what counts as "done" with this skill

A row for **every** recognizable subproblem the spec covers, in whichever file you chose. No exceptions for "this one is simple" — record `no dependency — N lines bespoke` so reviewers can audit. If you skip the row, the next session re-runs the discovery from scratch and may pick differently.

## When NOT to use this skill

Skip when the build is genuinely tiny:

- A small form with arithmetic at the bottom — not a "library subproblem"
- A counter card with a + button
- A static label, a short list of items, a small data viewer with a few lines of formatting
- Pure data structures (a small static array, a color palette, a fixed config list)

The threshold: **if you'd write more than ~30 lines of bespoke code AND the problem matches a recognizable category**, run this skill. Otherwise, skip.

## When the user explicitly opts out

If the user says *"no external libraries"* or *"keep it pure JS"* — respect that. Record the constraint in spec.md and skip future library/asset/service discovery. But ALWAYS confirm: *"You said no external libraries — that's a hard constraint, right? Some subproblems would need 100+ lines of custom code."* The user might mean "no charting library" but be fine with a map library; ambiguous "no external dependencies" shouldn't be assumed without checking.

## Common drift modes

- **Treating subproblems as a single kind.** A non-trivial card typically has multiple subproblems of mixed kinds (library + asset, library + service + asset, etc.). Walk through each subproblem by its own kind; classify the textures separately from the renderer, the API separately from the chart library.
- **Skipping recall.** Probing many versions of a library you already know is wasted curls. Recall first, verify once.
- **Verifying reachability without CORS for WebGL/canvas assets.** `curl -sI` returns 200 doesn't mean the asset works as a WebGL texture. Add `-H "Origin: ..."` and check `access-control-allow-origin` for assets used in WebGL / canvas / SubresourceIntegrity contexts.
- **Finding a library/asset/service and not recording the decision.** Reviewers (and the next session) can't tell what was tried and why. Commit the table row.
- **Recording "no dependency fits" without showing what was considered.** A real reason names alternatives and explains why each was rejected. Just writing "no library" hides the work.
- **Guessing content-addressed hash paths.** Hosts that use unguessable directory hashes always 404 on guessed variants. Use the host's lookup API or switch to a CORS-enabled mirror.

## Worked example — what good looks like

Imagine a 3D card showing one celestial body orbiting another, with realistic textures.

## Subproblems and their solutions

| Subproblem | Kind | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3D scene rendering | library | `<3d-lib>@<version>` via verified CDN URL | Industry-standard renderer; UMD bundle exposes a global; library-specific skill installed. |
| Camera | bespoke | Manual fixed camera (a few lines) | Common camera-control addons in this ecosystem are ESM-only across all distributed npm tarballs; manual camera suffices for a fixed orbit visualization. |
| Body surface textures | asset | Verified GitHub-served URLs with CORS `*` | Library's own examples directory mirror; CORS-enabled for WebGL use. |
| Starfield background | bespoke | Inline points geometry from a random sphere | Cheaper than a texture sphere for backdrop. |
| Orbital animation | bespoke | Trigonometric position on elapsed time | Simple uniform circular orbit; no library needed. |
```

Total tool calls expected for this discovery: one curl per asset URL plus one for the 3D library UMD verification. No `web_fetch`. Zero searches. ~30 seconds wall clock.

- `decompose-task/SKILL.md` and the `task-decomposer` agent — invoke this skill during plan writing; dependency decisions land in `interfaces.md`.
- `fix-bug/SKILL.md` — invoke this skill when a fix would need >30 lines of new bespoke code OR adds a new external resource.
- `card-class-handbook/SKILL.md` § Verify before declaring done — Tier 1 (URL reachability) and Tier 2 (CORS / library global / API shape) verifications happen at this skill's step 3, recorded in spec.md so the smoke test has a ledger to compare against.
